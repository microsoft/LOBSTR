# Linked Objects Transformer (LOBSTR)

LOBSTR is an image-to-graph model built on top of the Detection Transformer (DETR).

We provide a base architecture LOBSTR that can be trained directly for simple graphs.

We also provide a projects folder that shows how you can extend LOBSTR yourself to handle more complex graphs (for example, graphs with multiple node properties, graphs with multiple edge properties, or graphs involving 2D point objects instead of bounding boxes).
